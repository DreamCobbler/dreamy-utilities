# [Dreamy Utilities](https://github.com/DreamCobbler/dreamy-utilities) (*1.2.0*)

A set of various utilities for [Python](https://www.python.org/) applications.

I've found myself copy-pasting the same functions over and over again in my Python projects, and so I've decided to make a library out of them. **Dreamy Utilities** are currently used extensively by **[fiction-dl](https://github.com/DreamCobbler/fiction-dl)**.
