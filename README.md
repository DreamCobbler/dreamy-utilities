# [Dreamy Utilities](https://github.com/DreamCobbler/dreamy-utilities) (*1.0.0 alpha*)

A set of various utilities for [Python](https://www.python.org/) applications.

I've found myself copy-pasting the same functions over and over again in my Python projects, so I've decided to make a library out of them. **Dreamy Utilities** are extensively used by **[fiction-dl](https://github.com/DreamCobbler/fiction-dl)** 1.6.0; when this version of the application will be published, I'll post the utilities on PyPy.

The documentation can be generated using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html); install it, then execute the following commands:

	cd Docs
	doxygen Docs.doxygen
